# ECE2112-PA2-Parayno
This contains my PA2 for Numerical Python (NUMPY). Experiment 2 covers the codes and functions incorporated in the Numpy library. Also, be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Numpy library.

>The code that I made generated a random 5 x 5 matrix ' X ', which then calculates the mean and its standard deviation, and then attempts to normalize the matrix by subtracting the mean and dividing it by its standard deviation. The normalized matrix is saved to a file named "X_normalized.npy".

>The code that I made creates a 10 x 10 matrix of numbers from 1 to 100, then computes their squares, and filters the square numbers that are divisible by 3. It then saves it to a file named "div_by_3.npy".
